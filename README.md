# About me 
It's somewhat of a funny story. I started this blog because my friends tripped out on me like I'm some kind of hacker likely because I tell them all I'm just a "PC Tech". Well in retrospect, I guess I am. I'll hack at something until I get it to work. At least it feels that way at times, but to me it's a lot more than that. Technology has always been my passion and something I have been pretty decent at. Here you will find some of the various projects I have been working on. I've been on a computer since I was 5, made video games in 6th grade, and had a job since 15 working with computers in advanced ways. Copying one of my friends and avoiding Facebook. I'm just now playing catch up. Unfortunately I have always been more social online than I am in person.
