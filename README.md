# About me 

#### It's all a show, just watch.

#### Skitzen
I'm an activist, mental health, and human rights advocate that enjoys computers, but suffers from severe anxiety and depression on top of being a prior alcoholic, so I haven't been on them in the past few years as much. I started this blog because my friends tripped out on me like I'm some kind of hacker likely because I tell them all I'm just a "PC Tech", which at one point got me the label "Skizzen" which is what my blog is named after. "Skizzen" which means from German to English, "sketches", loosly translated to sketchy or sketch. It's crazy how quickly a story can be spun, from a foreign word to Skit Zen which could mean a calm act or an act of kindness. 

#### Past Life
I've been on a computer since I was 5, made video games in 6th grade, and had a job since 15 working with computers in advanced ways. Well in retrospect, I guess I am a "hacker". I'll hack at something until I get it to work. At least it feels that way at times, but to me it's a lot more than that. Technology has always been my passion and something I have been pretty decent at. To me I prefer Entreprenuer or Engineer, maybe Guru or even Nerd. Here you will find some of the various projects I have been working on since I made this site. Have I hacked people before? Probably as a kid screwing around, but it was merely prankster and never truly sinister. That started with a Gameshark though. Also, mimmicking one of my friends and avoiding Facebook, social "credation" tactics (abusing the need for approval), and abuse of a privacy policy. I'm just now playing catch up on that one I suppose. Unfortunately I have always been more social online than I am in person.

#### Current Focus
I guess I should explain a little about what these projects are. These projets are my contribution to Industry 4.0 and the Ethical Smart City. A decentralized non-utopian view of American cities with smart fiber-based infrastructure, self hosted applications, a server (even a raspberry pi) in every home, and a massive pipeline of data feeding it all that incorporates the requirement to privacy. In other words, big data still gets their data, it's just guarenteed anonymized by the person spending their energy bill on it already. A world where your average person can build a dataset and want to; with the tools at their disposal that are easy to use but currently hard to come by. 

These projects have a strong focus on:
- Freedom of Speech
- Decentralization, of storage and computing power, aka "grid computing"
- Encryption/Security, both in transport and at rest

#### Continuum
In other words, "Anti-NWO" (Preventing a second Holocost). A fear that quantum computing brings to me since I was a pre-teen and I was told it would break all my encryption that I used to hide my cheat codes, games, and collection of DVD rips and music. While I no longer condone pirating, I fear we have become to accustom to DRM, which for me started back in the early 2000's with Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour. It sucked, because if your internet bumped out even offline you were disconnected and unable to save your game. It's like the built DRM into the gameloop itself. I fear the day where we are all reliant on our accounts and passwords and the constitutional right to be secure in your possessions is void. I know I make enemies saying this, but: If I purchased something from a cloud service and it is mine, I should be able to have a copy in any way I see fit. DRM free.
